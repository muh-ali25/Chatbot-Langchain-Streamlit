# Chatbot-Langchain-Streamlit

This is a custom AI chatbot built with LangChain and Streamlit, powered by the Gemini API. The chatbot can handle general conversations as well as process uploaded PDF documents, allowing users to ask context-based questions directly from the files. With an intuitive Streamlit interface and LangChainâ€™s powerful orchestration, the project offers a seamless way to interact with LLMs for both casual chat and document-based Q&A.
